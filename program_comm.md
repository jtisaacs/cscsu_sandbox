## Seeking Program Committee Members for CSCSU'22

We will be holding the second annual CSCSU conference on March 5, 2022.  This venue is specifically for CSU CS undergraduates to publish peer-reviewed research, in collaboration with CSU faculty.  As part of this process, we are looking for volunteers to serve on the program committee and provide high-quality reviews.  To help illustrate the kinds of reviews we are looking for, please see the [review template](./Review_Template.html).  Note that submitted papers can fall into one of six [paper types](https://cscsu-conference.github.io/Paper%20types%202022.pdf), and review criteria specific for each paper type are listed in the template.

For these reviews, keep in mind that all papers are submitted by CSU undergraduates, and that this will likely be their first hands-on experience with peer review.  This is why it is of the upmost importance that these reviews are high-quality: students will need this feedback to improve their research skills, and we similarly want them to have a positive first experience with peer review.  This might (and often will) mean rejection.  However, whether a paper is accepted or rejected, students need to know exactly why.

If you are willing and able to serve on the program committee and write a high-quality review, please email anyone on the [organizing committee](./organizing_comm.html).

Sincerely,

Organizing Committee, Computer Science Conference for CSU Undergraduates
